## FAQ
#### How do I use git
[Read this helpful guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

#### What is Sass
Sass is a supposedly better CSS. Use a compiler such as [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) to generate CSS from Sass files.

#### How do I upload my changes to the website
You will most likely want to use [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org) or a similar program for FTP access. Download that then ask the previous maintainer or current tech deacon for credentials.

#### Why does this exist
Because collabing with someone over a synced gdrive is painful and you should know version control as a CS student.

#### There's two initial commits
I didn't know including the LICENSE would make a commit and I don't feel like rebasing to rewrite history

## Contributing
- DO NOT DIRECTLY MODIFY THE CSS. USE THE SASS FILES. that is all.
